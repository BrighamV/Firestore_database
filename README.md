# Overview


This is a simple webpage that has access to a firestore database. It is interactive in that the user can perform the CRUD operations from the database. The webpage acts as a way to query the data that is stored on googles firestore database that I set up. All information is imediatly saved in the database. This means that when something is added or deleted it is instantly reflected in firestore.

# Cloud Database

I used Googles firestore for this project.

The structure has 1 recipes collection. That collection has documents that represent the individual recipes that have name and time fields.
# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* git
* Javascript
* html
* css
* Googles Firebase Firestore


# Useful Websites

* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFLvSp4Mh9k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB&index=2)
* [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com)
* [GitHub](http://github.com)

# Future Work

* The database structure is still pretty primitive. I would love to add authors, instructions, and ingredients to make the website more useful. 
* The apperance is also lacking. I would love to make this page look nice and invite the user to use it.
